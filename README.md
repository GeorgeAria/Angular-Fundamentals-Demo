# NgFundamentals

## Tips and Tricks
* The Toastr library allows for good looking notifications in web app.
* Import any CSS-related files (like from Bootstrap) and Javascripts files imported from npm to the angular.json file.
* proxy.conf.json allows for the communication with the ngf-server. npm start in the package.json has code so that this happens.
* To start the ngf-server, use "npm run server".

## Homework
* In the nav-bar html code, make it so that the "Events" dropdown shows all events and links to the event page.
